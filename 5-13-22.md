  These are some notes I took while reading "Learn Vimscript the
  hard way." I implemented most of this already, but there might
  be some gems for further exploration somewhere.

Move a paragraph down by one

```
nmap - dap}p
```

Capitalize current word -- I don't like that this is <c-u>,
which I use, however.

```
imap <c-u> <esc>gUawea
```

Same as above, but in normal mode

```
nmap <c-u> gUawea
```

The LEADER can be mapped to anything with `let mapleader = ""`.
I currently have it set to `-`. Then you can do other neat
things with it, like `map <leader>d dd`. Handy way to change
things if ever necessary.

# The Big Picture

Both the alt keys (to be used as chords) and the `leader` key
(for combination commands such as `-d` are totally unexplored and
totally useful.
