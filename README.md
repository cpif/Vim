# Nvim Configuration

## Todo

- [ ] Document each file in `lua` (or delete them)
    - [x] checkbox.lua
    - [x] cipher.lua
    - [x] cleanquotes.lua
    - [x] filetypes.lua
    - [ ] floatingwindows.lua
    - [x] floatwin.lua
    - [ ] highlight.lua
    - [x] notepad.lua
    - [x] status.lua
    - [ ] strings.lua
    - [x] todo.lua
- [ ] Write about `init.lua`
- [ ] Add comments to the floating-window data structures
- [ ] Compare `highlight.lua` to `floatingwindows.lua`. They come
  from similar impetuses but have been handled very differently
  -- which is better?
- [ ] Similarly, check out `strings.lua`, which uses folds like
  `highlight.lua`
