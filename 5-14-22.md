  Once again, I'm looking at "Learn Vimscript the hard way."
  Today we're looking at autocommands.

Losh likes the idea of adding a filetype-specific abbreviation.
An example: `autocmd FileType js iab iff if ()<left>`. I don't
think I need anything like that, but do I? Certainly I could make
a list of abbreviations for commonly-cited books.

# Operator pending motions

Check out the following:

```
onoremap p i(
```

Obviously you could also do `omap`. The point, however, is that
the above defines a *motion* (here, "in parentheses") that can
then be used with normal commands like `d` and `c`.
