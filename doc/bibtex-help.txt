BIBTEX FORMAT DESCRIPTION                           *bibtex-format*

BibTeX-files may contain four different types of entries:

TYPE        FUNCTION                        NOTE    ~
@STRING     defines abbreviations:          abbreviation can be used:
            @string { foo = "Mrs. Foo" }    author = foo # " and Mr. Bar"

@PREAMBLE   defines how special text should
            be formatted.

@COMMENT    for comments not taken in 
            regard by BibTeX.

TAGS

A BibTeX tag is specified by its name followed by an equals-sign
and the content. The tag's name is not case-sensitive. The
content needs to be enclosed by either curly braces or
quotation-marks. Which form of enclosure is used is depending on
the user's taste, and both can be applied together in a single
BibTeX entry, but there is one difference between those two
methods: When quotation-marks are used, string concatenation
using # is possible, but not when braces are used.

For example, the following statements are equal:
>
    Title = {{Bib}\TeX} 
    Title = "{Bib}\TeX" 
    Title = "{Bib}" # "\TeX" 
<
It is important to know that abbreviations previously defined
using the @string command can only be used in conjunction with
other strings using the string concatenation.
>
    @string{btx = "{\textsc{Bib}\TeX}"} 
    Title = btx # "ing" 
<
Numbers can either be enclosed by braces or quotation-marks, but
can stand alone. Tags are separated by commas; if not, the BibTeX
parser will produce an error. The last tag can be finished with a
comma, although not necessarily.
>

    auTHor = "Mr. X", 
    Title = {Something Great}, 
    publisher = "nob" # "ody",

    }

is a correct BibTeX entry.
